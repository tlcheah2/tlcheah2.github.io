                    <p class="section-content about-me-content"><strong>I used to be a pack rat.</strong> I had so many
                        things that I thought that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because
                        there was too much.</p>
                    <p class="section-content about-me-content">Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that
                        I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.</p>
                    <p class="section-subtitle about-me-subtitle">How I turned things around</p>
                    <p class="section-content about-me-content"><strong>I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of
                            everything.</strong> I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and
                        moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.</p>
                    <p class="section-content about-me-content">It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such
                        a bad place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.</p>
                    <p class="section-subtitle about-me-subtitle">Now I live the simple life</p>
                    <p class="section-content about-me-content">Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much
                        better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy.</p>
                    <p class="section-content about-me-content">With how much it turned my life around, <strong>I felt like
                            I had no choice but to start sharing how I did it</strong>, and how others can benefit from
                        living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site!</p>
