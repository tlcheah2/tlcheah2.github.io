                            quickly</strong>, but it doesn't have to be! There are many
                        ways to simplify your life, a few of which we've explored in the past. This week we're taking a
                        bit of a
                        approach though, in how you can find simplicity in the life you already living.

                        want to be healthy, you
                        have to eat healthy. One of the easiest ways to do that is to keep your cooking nice and simple.

                    <p class="section-content article-subtitle">Work is often a major source of stress. People get
                        frustrated, it ruins their
                        relationship with others and it leads to burnout. By keeping your work life as simple as
                        possible, it will
                        help balance everything out.</p>

                        People either don't decorate,
                        or they go overboard and it doesn't have the impact they were hoping for. Staying simple will
                        help draw the
                        eye where you want it to and make things pop like never before.</p>
